### Network Security Projects For Phising Data

This end-to-end machine learning project gave me hands-on experience in building a complete production-ready ML system, not just training a model. I designed and implemented the full pipeline starting from data ingestion using MongoDB, data validation, feature transformation, and model training with hyperparameter tuning.

I also implemented experiment tracking using MLflow, automated model selection, and artifact management, which helped me understand how ML experiments are managed and compared in real industry workflows.

The project was further extended by deploying the trained model as a FastAPI application, containerizing it with Docker, and setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. Finally, the system was deployed on AWS infrastructure, simulating how ML models are served and maintained in production environments.

The most valuable learning from this project was debugging real-world issues, understanding project structure, handling logging and exception management, and realizing how small configuration or data errors can impact an entire pipeline. This experience strengthened my understanding of ML Engineering, MLOps practices, and production-level system design, and motivated me to continue building scalable and reliable ML solutions.
